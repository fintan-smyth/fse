# FSE

F(ile) S(ystem) E(xplorer) - A simple terminal file manager written in C.

This is just a fun little project I have been doing to test my skills in C, not to be taken too seriously. Heavy inspiration is taken from other terminal file mangers such as lf.

## Features

Currently there is only basic fuctionality. You can navigate through the filesystem and copy, cut, and paste files and directories. Files and empty directories can also be deleted. A simple text file preview is additionally included.
